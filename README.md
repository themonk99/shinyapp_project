Homicide Rates vs Electoral Vote Allocation
RHays Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

date: 03032021

Assignment Details
========================================================

After creating my shiny app, now it's time to make my pitch. I get 5 slides 
(inclusive of the title slide) to pitch my app. I created this web page 
using Rstudio Presenter, with an html5 slide deck.

My presentation must satisfy the following:

It must be done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
It must be 5 pages
It must be hosted on github or Rpubs
It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

Shiny Application Summary
========================================================
Based on data compiled by the CDC (dated noted on next slide), the average national homicide
rate for 2019 was 6.16% per 100,000. The results of the 2020 Presidential Election
allocated each state's electoral votes to one of the two political parties - Republican, Democratic.(US Archives data noted on next slide).

My shiny app will allow the user to select a State and view the following:
which party was allocated the state's electoral votes
what the 2019 homicide rate was for that state
and the actual number of homicides
